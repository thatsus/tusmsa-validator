TUSMSA Validator
===

Beta: The Validator itself probably works, but this repo does not have an appropriate environment set up to test it. Until we do that, we cannot recommend the usage of the Validator.

Validate response data against the TUSMSA spec at http://lister.engager.social/spec/1.0.txt

## Requirement

* Laravel or Lumen 5.1+
* Blade templating engine

## Installation

The package can be installed via Composer by requiring the "lotvantage/tusmsa-validator": "1.0.*" package in your project's composer.json.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "lotvantage/tusmsa-validator": "1.0.*"
    },
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url":  "git@github.com:thatsus/tusmsa-validator.git"
        }
    ]
}
```
